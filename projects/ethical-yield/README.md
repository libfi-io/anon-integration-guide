# Ethical Yield

## Overview

The Ethical Yield module addresses a critical gap in decentralized finance by providing Shariah-compliant yield opportunities to over 1.2 billion Muslims worldwide. Traditional DeFi often involves interest-based (riba) mechanisms or speculative (gharar) elements that prevent many users from participating in digital financial opportunities. This module enables users to:

- Access vetted, Shariah-compliant yield protocols
- Generate halal returns on digital assets
- Participate in ethical DeFi without compromising religious principles
- Automate compliant investment strategies

By focusing on transparent, asset-backed yield generation methods and avoiding interest-based lending, Ethical Yield opens DeFi to a significant global population previously excluded from these financial opportunities.

This module removes complexity for users while creating a new paradigm in self-custody driven finance. The experience is as simple as calling your broker to invest in a high-yield fund, but instead, you're doing it via a prompt with no central intermediary â€“ true decentralized, ethical finance at your fingertips.
